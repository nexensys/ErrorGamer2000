### About Me

> Yes, yes I am highly neurodivergent. If this bothers you, and you are unable to understand that others are allowed to be their own person, leave me alone. Don't read any further than this. I don't care what names you try calling me, it doesn't work.

I'm a furry. Deal with it. As you most likely saw from the badges I'm also an otherkin kitsune with a fox other and Aro-ace. I have mild to near crippling social anxiety depending on the day, and am extremely self-concious, so expect me to come across somewhat tentative if we are talking. I'm currently a freshman attending the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology persuing a degree in Computer Science. I taught myself JavaScript in 2020 during the virtual school year and have expanded that knowledge to TypeScript, C/C++, a little Java, and am now looking into C#. I am able to teach myself extremely quickly withing the programming realm, and find learning new languages to be somewhat of a walk in the park. The only concept I have struggled to learn is low-level computer mechanics, something I hope will be fixed relatively soon.
